## Installation

    composer require mll-lab/graphql-php-scalars

## Usage

You can use the provided Scalars just like any other type in your schema definition.
Check [SchemaUsageTest](tests/SchemaUsageTest.php) for an example. 

## Simple Scalars

This package comes with a bunch of scalars that are ready-to-use and just work out of the box.

### [Email](src/Email.php)

A [RFC 5321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321) compliant email.

### [JSON](src/JSON.php)

Arbitrary data encoded in JavaScript Object Notation. See https://www.json.org/.

### [Mixed](src/MixedScalar.php)

Loose type that allows any value. Be careful when passing in large `Int` or `Float` literals,
as they may not be parsed correctly on the server side. Use `String` literals if you are
dealing with really large numbers to be on the safe side.

## Advanced Scalars

### [Regex](src/Regex.php)

The `Regex` class allows you to define a custom scalar that validates that the given
value matches a regular expression.

The quickest way to define a custom scalar is the `make` factory method. Just provide
a name and a regular expression and you will receive a ready-to-use custom regex scalar.

```php
use MLL\GraphQLScalars\Regex;

$hexValue = Regex::make(
    'HexValue',
    'A hexadecimal color is specified with: `#RRGGBB`, where `RR` (red), `GG` (green) and `BB` (blue) are hexadecimal integers between `00` and `FF` specifying the intensity of the color.',
    '/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/'
);
```

You may also define your regex scalar as a class.

```php
use MLL\GraphQLScalars\Regex;

// The name is implicitly set through the class name here
class HexValue extends Regex
{
    /**
     * The description that is used for schema introspection.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public $description = <<<'DESCRIPTION'
A hexadecimal color is specified with: `#RRGGBB`, where `RR` (red), `GG` (green) and `BB` (blue)
are hexadecimal integers between `00` and `FF` specifying the intensity of the color.
DESCRIPTION;

    public static function regex(): string
    {
        return '/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/';
    }
}
```

### [StringScalar](src/StringScalar.php)

The `StringScalar` encapsulates all the boilerplate associated with creating a string-based Scalar type.
It does the proper string checking for you and let's you focus on the minimal logic that is specific to your use case.

All you have to specify is a function that checks if the given string is valid.
Use the factory method `make` to generate an instance on the fly.

```php
use MLL\GraphQLScalars\StringScalar;

$coolName = StringScalar::make(
    'CoolName',
    'A name that is most definitely cool.',
    static function (string $name): bool {
        return in_array($name, [
           'Vladar',
           'Benedikt',
           'Christopher',
        ]);
    }
);
```

Or you may simply extend the class, check out the implementation of the [Email](src/Email.php) scalar to see how.
